# 3D Checkers using Untiy Engine
  * The checkers game is a college project for the third year. I used the standered rules of the game.You can change the type of play so you can play with a bot or another humen (on the same device or remotly).
  * The interface is completely three-dimensional, based on coroutine for all movement operations (building board, moving pieces and switching roles between players).
  * I added the feature **Maximum Eat** so that the player can in a certain situations eat more than one piece at a his role.
  * I also added a pause menu that includes (help, restart, save, etc.).
  * Finally, I added some simple animation **Glowing Flying Dust** to make the interface more attractive.
